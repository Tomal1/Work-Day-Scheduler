## Usage

Once the app is opened it displays current time at the top of the calender, if the client scrolls down it can be seen that the blocks of time are separated by hours (timeblocks) that also represent orthodox working hours.

Each timeblock is automatically colour coded representing either the past, present or future; the client can click each timeblock to enter a value and then click the blue button next to the timeblock to save it.

Each data will be stored in the local storage
